"""Extend the puzzle schedule from images that are approved but unscheduled.

Two things are balanced at once.

**Difficulty** — every day runs easy to hard, so round 1 is a win and round 5
is a fight.

**Variety** — a day should not be five space photographs, and two consecutive
days should not both open in the United States. The library is lopsided (63%
US, space the largest topic by far), so left alone a naive scheduler produces
days that feel repetitive even though each photograph is individually fine.

Scoring picks each slot: candidates are penalised for repeating a topic already
used in the day, and for repeating topics or countries used in recent days. It
is a preference, not a hard rule — a thin pool still schedules rather than
refusing, it just does the best it can.

Usage:
    python3 tools/schedule_next.py
    python3 tools/schedule_next.py --days 7
    python3 tools/schedule_next.py --dry-run
